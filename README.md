 # Dash Language School - A Language School to learn foreign languages.

The main purpose of this project was to provide a payment and informational platform for a language school with offices in Lagos, Nigeria. This website was created to provide various users with comprehensive information on the four foreign languages the school offers. Using a secure payment gateway, a user can preview a course, choose whether it fits into their schedule, then pay for it ("Paystack").
