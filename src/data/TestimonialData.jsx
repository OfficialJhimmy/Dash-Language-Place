      "At Dash Language School learning German and French is fun. It is a great experience for me and I am pleased. However German and French are difficult, But DASH makes it easy for me through their extraordinary teaching skill like:- listening to the text, working in groups, reading out dialogue, writing a letter, speaking to one another, and doing vocabulary tests. These aspects has helped me improve my language skills. A big thanks to their professional teacher for a job well done. You learn best and covienently at Dash Language School.",
